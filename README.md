You can use *Einstein* for testing your scripts; for example...

```
$ einstein triple-a-words.bash
```

But your submission must be by forking this project, adding your scripts to your repo
and pushing your work back to GitLab.

The validation script in this directory just uploads your work to *Einstein* for testing.
